# 3D-Printer
This is the documentation for my diy 3D printer project.

**Inspiration**
The inspiration for this project came when I read an article about how much of a 3D printer could be 3D printed. This article was not meant to be the most practicle way to make a diy printer, but rather explored how many elements of a 3D printer could be made from scratch. Unfortuantely, among the prerequisites was listed "knowledge on how to wire and code a 3D printer," which I lacked at the time. Still, the idea stuck with me. As my graduation from 8th grade drew near howerver, and my unlimited access to the school printer was drawing to a close, I began to do some more serious research on making my own from scratch. Thus, my 3D printer project was born.
