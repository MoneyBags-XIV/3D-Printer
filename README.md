# 3D-Printer
This is the documentation for my diy 3D printer project.

**Inspiration**

The inspiration for this project came when I read an article about how much of a 3D printer could be 3D printed. This article was not meant to be the most practicle way to make a diy printer, but rather explored how many elements of a 3D printer could be made from scratch. Unfortuantely, among the prerequisites was listed "knowledge on how to wire and code a 3D printer," which I lacked at the time. Still, the idea stuck with me. As my graduation from 8th grade drew near however, and my unlimited access to the school printer was drawing to a close, I began to do some more serious research on making my own from scratch. Thus, my 3D printer project was born.

**Resources**

My primary source of information in building this project was a general guide on diy 3D printers by Dr D-Flo and the accompanying YouTube video (linked below). Unfortunately, I was not keeping track of the other resources that I used at the time that I did this project, so I do not have a complete list. However, I do know that I also relied heavily on the YouTuber, Chris Riley (linked below).
